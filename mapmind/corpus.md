A few things to keep in mind when searching for high-quality datasets:
1.- A high-quality dataset should not be messy, because you do not want to spend a lot of time cleaning data.
2.- A high-quality dataset should not have too many rows or columns, so it is easy to work with.
3.- The cleaner the data, the better — cleaning a large dataset can be incredibly time-consuming.
4.- Your end-goal should have a question/decision to answer, which in turn can be answered with data.

Dataset Finders
================

* [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch): Similar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they’re hosted, whether it’s a publisher’s site, a digital library, or an author’s personal web page.

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): A data science site that contains a variety of externally contributed to interesting datasets. You can find all kinds of niche datasets in its master list, from ramen ratings to basketball data to and even Seattle pet licenses.

* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/): One of the oldest sources of datasets on the web, and a great first stop when looking for interesting datasets. Although the data sets are user-contributed and thus have varying levels of cleanliness, the vast majority are clean. You can download data directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository, without registration.

* [VisualData](https://www.visualdata.io/): Discover computer vision datasets by category, it allows searchable queries.
