## Smart IoT Concepts for Intelligent Farming

### Predicting Pest Existence

Enabling smart IoT techniques to allow farmers to take preventive actions and save against losses with increased ROI. Moreover, predictive insights about the pest attacks in a particular region help the farmers to adopt intelligence as the key alternative for reducing crop loss due to pests.

### Drone Monitoring

It is one of the most innovative ways to capture real-time data from the fields and track every activity of the entire farm. These devices help the farmers as their assistants by hovering over the entire land and analyze the growth rate of the crops. An IoT-powered drone device gathers multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral imageries to grab every information of the field and measures crop health via heat signatures.

### Crop Screening through IoT

Smart farming through IoT is a stepping stone to constitute millions of devices or assets for intelligent decisions and better agricultural practices. Enhancing the traditional ways by implementing the latest technology not only helps the farmers in better production but also increases the chances of gaining profits.
