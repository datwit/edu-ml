<p>Prepare for job interviews</p>
<p>What experience do you have in real projects?Which SQL query would
you write to extract this information from that database? Do you
know Docker and Kubernetes? What about Spark? Have you administered
a Hadoop cluster? Have you used Elastic? What experience do you
have with Kafka? OK… there are countless technologies we haven’t
touched (so far) which may come up at a certain point. But I
consider them as add-ons you’ll need (or not), with the only
objective of passing the interview for a position where additional
knowledge is needed (or not xD). Don’t think too much about this,
and never use it as an excuse to postpone your first interview:
you’ve already learned a lot of things, which by the way were far
more important and complicated. As a tip: If you see that some
requirement is repeated a lot in job offers that you like… maybe
you should keep an eye on it. If you go to an interview and fail in
a question… take note, go home, and strengthen your knowledge on
that subject. Doing interviews is part of the journey; the most
important thing is that you must assimilate it from the beginning
and learn from it!</p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>
<p>Learn by doing: The best way to learn something is to put it into practice. Spend most of your time writing code. And I’ll say it again: do projects!</p>
<p>Organize your agenda. Try to spend some time learning each day. Set small milestones with realistic deadlines (you can use a board if that helps you) and try to meet them. Check what you could accomplish and what you couldn’t. Don’t get overwhelmed, but do not relax either :)</p>
<p>Learn as if you had to teach: Take notes, make summaries, draw diagrams… very good! But you don’t really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. And that’s the reason why I decided to start this blog :) You can follow the Feynman technique.</p>
<p>Take the top-down approach. With a bottom-up approach, what we would do is to follow the classic flow of learning: learn first all the small pieces before you can reach the whole. An example of this approach would be to choose an Algebra course, another one for Calculus and one more for Probability and Statistics, with the only purpose of being able to face the Machine Learning algorithms. With a top-down approach, we’ll simply try to learn Machine Learning, scratching (or deepening) the mathematical part when necessary.This way we won’t lose the motivation, the focus, or our time with something maybe irrelevant. Did you learn what offsides is before playing your first soccer game?</p>
<p>Be resourceful: there are a lot of available resources and tools (click on the link!). As important as having a solid knowledge is the ability to quickly locate what we don’t know or don’t remember.</p>
<p>Upload your projects to GitHub. Those will be your credentials to apply for the job you want. If you don’t have paid experience, you’ll need to prove experience with your own projects. On the Internet, you can find a lot of ideas or papers, and you can also try to solve a real problem or a concern of your day-to-day.</p>
<p>Don’t let yourself be drownedby the amount of information published daily. There are many people doing very interesting and innovative things, but you need to focus on acquiring the base that will enable you to become a data scientist; you can ignore what is published every minute on Twitter.</p>
<p>Prepare the interviews thoroughly. There’s a lot of information on this (lists of typical questions, tips to improve your CV, …) and even mentors if you need extra help. By the way: it is essential that you are able to explain what you did in your data projects.</p>
<p>Remain up to date once the goal is reached. Subscribe to the most relevant blogs and newsletters, follow the data gurus on Twitter or Linkedin, participate in forums, attend meetups, try to be Gold in a Kaggle competition, or simply expand your skills.</p>
